# Introduction

This plugin will automatically upload a backup upon completion to your authorized Google Drive. In order for the plugin to work properly you will have to create a Google OAuth App to authorize access. To create your own Google OAuth app please follow the directions outlined in the Prerequisites section later in this guide.

### To-Do

* [x] Improve documentation.  
* [ ] Add route hook to allow for local redirect URIs during authentication.
* [ ] Delete certs instead of just clearing flags to start over.
* [ ] Improve error handling, display messages in UI.
