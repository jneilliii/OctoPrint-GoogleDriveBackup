# Google Drive Backup

This plugin will automatically upload a backup upon completion to your authorized Google Drive. In order for the plugin to work properly you will have to create a Google OAuth App to authorize access. To create your own Google OAuth app please follow the directions outlined in the Prerequisites section below.

## Prerequisites

### OctoPrint 1.5.0
If you are using a version of OctoPrint older than version 1.5.0, this plugin will not work.

### Dependencies
Due to upstream dependencies this plugin has been updated to only work in Python 3. You can either flash OctoPi 0.18 which ships with Python 3 standard or use the upgrade instructions [here](https://github.com/cp2004/Octoprint-Upgrade-To-Py3) to upgrade your instance.

You may also need to install some system dependencies, specifically if you manually installed OctoPrint and didn't use the OctoPi image. Known dependencies that have been reported are `Rust` and `libssl-dev`. Use the commands to below to install them.

```
sudo apt install rustc
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-GoogleDriveBackup/archive/master.zip

## Configuration
Once the Prerequisite steps above have been completed and you have downloaded your client_secrets.json file follow these steps to authorize the plugin to your newly created app.

1. Open OctoPrint's settings from the System menu at the top of the page and select `Google Drive Backup` in the left-hand navigation menu. <br>

2. Use the `Browse` button to select your downloaded client_secrets#####.json file and press the `Upload` button. <br>
![screenshot](screenshots/configuration_step2.png)
3. An authentication URL will be generated and presented to you. Click that new URL to open a new window and authorize your custom Google app. <br>
![screenshot](screenshots/configuration_step3.png)
4. Log in to your Google account you want to give Drive access to. You will get a warning that the App isn't verified. This is normal as you have not submitted your custom app for verification by Google. You can choose to do that if you want but is not necessary for the operation of the plugin. Click the `Advanced` link at the bottom of the page and the click `Go to <app name>`. <br>

5. Click the `Allow` button to retrieve your authentication code to enter in the plugin's settings in the next step. <br>

6. Copy the code from step 5 and paste it into the **Auth Code** field and click `Authorize`. <br>
